# Codetech---Task-2-Automated-report-generation-
Here's a Python script that reads data from a CSV file, analyzes it, and generates a formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The script will compute basic statistics (like mean, max, min, etc.) for numerical data in the CSV and include these in the PDF report.

# You can install fpdf using:
pip install fpdf

# How it Works:
read_csv_data(file_path): Reads the data from a CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row with column names as keys.

analyze_data(data): Takes the data and calculates basic statistics (mean, min, max, median, standard deviation) for each numerical column.

generate_pdf_report(analysis, file_path): Generates a PDF report with a summary of the statistics and saves it as a PDF file.

main(): This is the entry point of the script. It reads the CSV file, analyzes the data, and generates a PDF report.

# CSV File Example:

Name,Age,Height,Weight
John,28,175,70
Jane,32,160,60
Alice,24,168,58
Bob,35,180,85

# Explanation:

# 1. Import necessary libraries:

fpdf: For creating the PDF document.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
# 2. Define the generate_pdf_report function:

Takes input_file and output_file paths as arguments.
Reads the data from the input file using pd.read_csv (adjust for different file types).
Performs data analysis (e.g., calculates summary statistics).
Creates an FPDF object.
Adds a title and basic information to the PDF.
Adds the summary statistics table to the PDF.
Optionally adds other sections like charts, tables, or text.
Saves the PDF report using pdf.output().
# 3. Call the function with input/output file paths:

Replace "data.csv" and "report.pdf" with your actual file paths.
# To use this script:

# 1. Install required libraries:

Bash

pip install fpdf pandas
# 2. Replace placeholders:

Change "data.csv" to the actual path of your input file.
Modify the data analysis part (line 17) to suit your specific needs.
Add more sections to the report as required.
# 3. Run the script:

Bash

python your_script_name.py
This will generate a PDF report in the specified location.
